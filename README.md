Before you get started anything you need to create your NEW Application bot in https://discord.com/developers , Then copy and save your Application Bot's TOKEN (Please don't share this with anyone, Because whoever has it will have full access to your bot, for example they can Nuked your server!)
**Make sure that your Bot have access to the Intents in the Portal**

Now you need to install Javascript Environment Run (Node.js) in your Computer, Simply visit the https://nodejs.org and download the Verison 16.9 or higher, Because the Discord.js V14 is only valid in this version!

After the download is complete, Open your code Editor, I recommend for you to use Visual Studio Code, You can download this Application on your computer in https://code.visualstudio.com

Now Open your Toggle Panel with
```
CTRL + J 
```
Select the Terminal Option and Type
```
npm init -y
```
for create package.json to save your modules

Now you need to install all required package such as Discord.js module with
```
npm install
```
If is not worked use this in your terminal:
<hr>

```
npm install discord.js
```
and
```
npm install @discordjs/voice
```

<hr>

wait to install...
and Now create a NEW file with
```
CTRL + Alt + Windows + N
```
and set the name to anything you want such as: `index.js`, `bot.js`, `main.js`

Then Upload the source of this repository along with your personal information for example: `botToken`, `prefix`, `voiceChannelId` and `rgbRoleId` in config.json

Now enter the following command in your terminal to run and processing your file and wait for response...
``` 
node .
```

ðŸŽ‰Congratulations your bot was successfully online!


have a good day and enjoy your new bot :)
